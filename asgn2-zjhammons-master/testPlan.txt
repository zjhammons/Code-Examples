Partial of test plan that tests the command line arguments
command      input  output         rationale
no arguments        nothing        verify program starts up and shuts down
wash a b c    q     nothing        verify program correctly quits after startup
wash a        n     nothing        verify program correctly quits at end of list
wash a b c    n q   nothing        verify program correctly quits after next
wash a b c    c q   contents of a  verify program get contents to screen (assuming that a exists)
wash a b c    c q   "a not found"  verify program print error message to screen (where a does not exists)
wash a b c    t q   nothing        verify file a is created and has length zero (where file a does not exist)
wash a b c    c q   nothing        verify file a now has zero length (where file a exists)

Black box test plan for 'c' cat command
command			input		output			rationale
wash a(empty file) 	c	        "nothing in file"	Let the user know that there was nothing in the file to view error
wash a b 		c n		file a contents		test that it will display file a contents
			c n		file b contents		test that it will display the next files contents
			c n 		"no more files"		test that it knows when there are no files next
wash a(hugefile)	c		"file too large"	display error message if file too large to display
